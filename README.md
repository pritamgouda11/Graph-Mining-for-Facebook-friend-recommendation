 In this task, we are given a directed social graph, where nodes symbolize users and directed edges indicate their connections. The objective is to forecast missing links within the graph, effectively recommending new connections. We will try to  identify potential connections that haven't yet been established.

## Graph Mining
One of the methods used to analyze big data is to handle it as graph data. Graph data consist of nodes and edges, where each edge connects two nodes. Graph mining is a technique for discovering hidden relationships between various data by analyzing graph data. The amount of research on graph data has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and more services that generate graph data, for example, social networking services (SNSs) are being offered. Consequently, graph mining is becoming a major trend in big data analysis. However, efficient techniques for analyzing web-scale graph data have not been well established yet.
